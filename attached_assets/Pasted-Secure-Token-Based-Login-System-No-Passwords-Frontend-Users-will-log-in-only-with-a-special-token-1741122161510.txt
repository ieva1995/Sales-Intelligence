Secure Token-Based Login System (No Passwords)
Frontend:
Users will log in only with a special token generated by your software.

The token will be one-time-use and encrypted before being stored.
Users will never use passwords.
Backend:

When a user logs in, validate the token.
If valid, generate a temporary JWT (JSON Web Token).
Encrypt the JWT using AES Encryption.
Store the JWT in HttpOnly Secure Cookies (preventing session hijacking).
2. Advanced Security Layers 🔐
Frontend Security:

Obfuscate and minify all frontend code.
Detect if DevTools are opened using custom JavaScript code.
Block any attempt to use Inspect Element or manipulate the DOM.
Backend Security:

Use fingerprints based on:
Browser, OS, IP address, Device Resolution, and User Agent.
Every API request will include a hash checksum to detect if the request was tampered with.
Any tampered request will result in a blocked user and permanent ban of the token.
Security Flow:

Tokens are encrypted, and fingerprints are matched to prevent session hijacking.
Requests are checked for tampering in real time.
3. User Isolation
Multi-Tenant Architecture:
Each user will have their own isolated interface, meaning:

No user can see another user’s data (leads, orders, campaigns).
As the Admin, you have full access to all data, but users can only see their own.
Backend Implementation:

API endpoints will verify each request using the user_id.
No user will have access to data they are not authorized to see.
Admin Features:

Shadow-login to see other users’ accounts.
Generate tokens for users in case they lose access.
Manage the overall system and view reports for all stores.
4. Contact System (Email Button + Form)
Frontend Contact Button:
At the bottom of the site, a clickable email button will open a modal contact form when clicked.
The form includes fields like:
Name
Email
Subject
Message
Attachment (optional)
CAPTCHA for bot prevention
jsx
Copy
Edit
<Button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Contact Us</Button>

{modalOpen && (
  <Modal onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)}>
    <form method="POST" action="/api/contact">
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
      <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" required />
      <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
    </form>
  </Modal>
)}
Backend (Node.js + Express):
Handle POST requests for contact submissions, validating fields and sending an email using Nodemailer.
js
Copy
Edit
app.post("/api/contact", async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, message } = req.body;

  if (!name || !email || !message) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "All fields are required" });
  }

  await sendEmail(name, email, message);
  res.status(200).json({ message: "Message sent successfully" });
});
Nodemailer (Sending Email via Gmail SMTP):
js
Copy
Edit
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail",
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL,
    pass: process.env.PASSWORD,
  },
});

async function sendEmail(name, email, message) {
  await transporter.sendMail({
    from: email,
    to: process.env.EMAIL,
    subject: `Contact Form Submission from ${name}`,
    text: message,
  });
}
Security for Contact Form:
Encrypt all form data during transmission via HTTPS.
Prevent spam via invisible Google reCAPTCHA.
Rate-limiting of 3 submissions per user per day.
