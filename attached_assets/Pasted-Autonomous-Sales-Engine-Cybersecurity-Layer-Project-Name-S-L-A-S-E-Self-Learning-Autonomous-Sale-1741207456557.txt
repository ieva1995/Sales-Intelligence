Autonomous Sales Engine + Cybersecurity Layer
Project Name: S.L.A.S.E (Self-Learning Autonomous Sales Engine)
Cybersecurity Layer Name: GhostGuard AI

Key Features to Implement:
Autonomous Sales Engine

Self-learning AI that automatically generates the best sales strategies based on real-time data.
Google search behavior analysis, competitor price tracking, and dynamic offer generation.
Adaptive checkout flow that personalizes the experience per user.
Neural network-powered copywriting that optimizes product descriptions automatically.
Real-time customer emotional sentiment detection through chat or browsing behavior.
Cybersecurity Layer (GhostGuard AI)

AI Behavioral Firewalls: Track user behavior patterns instead of just IP addresses.
Deep Fake Honeytraps: Fake customer accounts to lure and track intruders.
Self-Destruct Protocol: Automatic encryption and disappearance in case of unauthorized access.
Zero Trust Architecture: Every request needs to prove identity — even internal system requests.
Polymorphic Code Encryption: The software must rewrite itself every time it's deployed.
Master Control System

Offline Biometric Access Key with face scan or fingerprint.
Quantum Backup Vault with hidden backups only accessible with biometric decryption.
Time-Locked Security Panel to freeze the system for 24-48 hours in case of attack.
Dead Man Switch to rebuild itself automatically on pre-approved devices if master access is lost.
Obfuscation & Reverse Engineering Protection
Virtualized Code Execution: The entire software runs inside a custom-built VM.
Runtime Code Mutation: Functions, variable names, and execution order mutate automatically every few hours.
Decoy Engine: If unauthorized access is detected, the system deploys a fake engine with misleading data while the real system runs in the background.
Development Stack
Module	Technology
Backend AI Core	Python + TensorFlow + PyTorch
Frontend	React.js + Next.js
Cybersecurity	Rust + Assembly
Database	PostgreSQL + Blockchain Backup
Virtual Machine	WebAssembly (WASM) + Custom Encryption
Developer Notes
The entire engine should be black box technology — not even developers should fully understand how the AI makes decisions.
Use different programming languages in different parts of the system to make reverse engineering nearly impossible.
Any unauthorized code access attempt should trigger stealth surveillance on the attacker.
